        "I'm running overcooked v1 and v2 from jaxmarl here with random actions and visualising the results. Examples for more JaxMARL environments can be found [here](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/tree/main/jaxmarl/tutorials).\n",

        "* `actions`, `obs`, `rewards`, `dones` are dictionaries keyed by agent name, this allows for differing action and observation spaces. As agents can terminate asychronously, `dones` contains a special `\"__all__\"` which signifies whether an episode has terminated.\n",
        "* `state` represents the internal state of the environment and contains all the information needed to transistion the environment given a set of actions. These variables are not held within the environment class due to JAX transformations requiring pure functions. This contains the `grid` with shape (timesteps, height, width, 3 channels). The 3 channels are (1) static items like wall, agent, ingredient, button etc, (2) dynamic items like plate (plate goes from plate to things on it) or cooked (whether something is cooked or uncooked), and (3) extra info.\n",
